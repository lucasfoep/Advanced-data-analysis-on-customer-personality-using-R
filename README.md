The exploratory_data_analysis_v5.R script conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer personality dataset. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to derive insights from the data, which allowed for the next step.

These scripts were created to investigate customer personality traits and their relationships with marketing behaviors. The PFA and CFA analysis aimed to uncover underlying psychological constructs, while the EDA script provided a detailed overview of the dataset's structure and characteristics. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to understanding customer data for strategic marketing decisions.
