# What do they do?

The exploratory_data_analysis_v5.R script conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer personality dataset. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to derive insights from the data, which facilitated the next step. The pfa_cfa_on_customer_personality_analysis.R script performs principal factor analysis (PFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the same dataset, aiming to identify latent factors and evaluate their validity using statistical techniques. Together they allowed me to craft business strategy recommendations based on customers' profile.

# Why have I made it?

These scripts were created, as part of DePaul's MS in Data Science program, to investigate customer personality traits and their relationships with marketing behaviors. The PFA and CFA analysis aimed to uncover underlying psychological constructs, while the EDA script provided a detailed overview of the dataset's structure and characteristics. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to understanding customer data for strategic marketing decisions.
